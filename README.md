### Clone Threads App with Firebase

Previously I've made an app similar to this but it was not an actual app with a proper database, driven by fake datas.

But in this one you can write your own threads with images and change your profile details.

Things I am going to add:

- Ability to remove/delete threads and profile information.
- Ability to edit, reply and like threads.
- Add notification features.
- Also I have a viewport issue right now. (Width is divided by 2, can not figure out why, fixed it by using some hooks temporarily)

This app is highly inspired and forked from:

- [@betomoedano](https://github.com/betomoedano)'s [React-Native-Threads-Clone](https://github.com/betomoedano/React-Native-Threads-Clone)
- [@SSA-988](https://github.com/SSA-988)'s [threads-app](https://github.com/SSA-988/threads-app)
